# About Me

I'm a Python and Web Developer Advocate at JetBrains. Before that, I
was a co-founder of Zope Corporation, taking the first open source application
server through $14M of funding. Prior to that, I was an officer in the
US Navy, starting www.navy.mil in 1993.

I've done open source organizing stuff: I bootstrapped both the Python
Software Foundation and the Plone Foundation.
